# coding-practice

I'm going through [Replit's 100 days of code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python), just to throw myself some new and quick problems to solve, and try to learn or practice something new or unusual along the way. For some, I'm modifying the mentioned task to make it a bit harder. I also skipped a few of the early ones just because they were simple ones. 

Just making this public to keep myself somewhat accountable.
