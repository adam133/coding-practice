ðŸ‘‰ Day 6 Challenge
Make your own login program.
Create a program where someone logins with their username and password correctly and then gets a lovely individual greeting.
Write a specific personalized greeting for 3 different people.
Don't forget an else statement for everyone else who shouldn't be logging in.


Notes:
I made this a bit more complex to make it a bit more interesting. Actually save/load the user and password from .env file
